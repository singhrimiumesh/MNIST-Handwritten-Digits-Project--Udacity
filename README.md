# Handwritten Digits Classifier

This is my **first project** under the **AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree Program**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this project, I developed a handwritten digits classifier using **PyTorch**. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To design, train, and evaluate a neural network that can accurately classify handwritten digits.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- PyTorch
- MNIST dataset
- Google Colab

## ðŸš€ Outcome

A trained neural network capable of classifying handwritten digits with high accuracy.
